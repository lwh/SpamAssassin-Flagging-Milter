This is a milter for Sendmail that uses Spamassassin and flags mail as spam or not.
It's a modified version of milter-spamd http://www.benzedrine.ch/milter-spamd.html.
Source is here: https://github.com/lwh/SpamAssassin-Flagging-Milter

WARNING - this is old and may not work anymore. I switched to Spamass-Milter from here:
