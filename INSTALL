To install this milter:

Install SpamAssassin and get spamd running. See http://spamassassin.apache.org/
Install Sendmail and its source code. 

Check the Makefile, the CFLAGS for sendmail's include files may have to be
changed.

Edit the source and set the options at the top, these three mainly:

#define USER      "_milter-spamd"
#define OCONN     "unix:/var/spool/milter-spamd/sock"
#define PIDFILE   "/var/spool/milter-spamd/pid"


Run make install and it should be installed as 
/usr/local/sbin/milter-spamd-flagger


Add it to your system startup , there is a FreeBSD rc script in this directory.


Add it to Sendmail , in your mc file(s) like this:
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`milter-spamd-flagger',`S=unix:/var/spool/milter-spamd/sock, T=S:30;R:60')

That's it. Mail will have an X-Spam header in it that says Yes/No


Tested on FreeBSD 4.8,6.x,7.x. If you get it working on others please
email me or send PR via github, particularily if you have patches or rc scripts.
